# TPU-related runtime extras (install on TPU VM or container that targets TPU)
# NOTE: torch-xla installation is environment/TPU-version-specific. See docs/tpu_support.md for exact commands.
# Example (TPU VM): pip install torch torch-xla -f https://storage.googleapis.com/pytorch-tpu-releases/wheels.html
torch>=2.0.0
# torch_xla is not on PyPI; install matching wheel for your TPU runtime
# jax and jaxlib are optional for JAX-based models on TPU
# jax[cuda]==... or jaxlib versions for TPU are ecosystem specific; consult vendor docs
