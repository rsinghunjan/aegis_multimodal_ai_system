# Canonical top-level direct dependencies for Aegis.
# Add only direct top-level runtime dependencies here, not transitive or local paths.
# After editing, generate a locked requirements.txt via:
#   pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements.in

# Example (replace with your project's real top-level deps):
# flask==2.2.5
# requests==2.31.0
# numpy==1.26.4
