 - The PR comment uses a marker <!-- aegis-readiness-check --> so subsequent runs will update the same comment instead of posting new ones.
 
+Status: IMPLEMENTED

+The readiness poller and notifier have been implemented and are active. See docs/READINESS_BADGE.md for a small README snippet you can paste into the repo README to show the last-run placeholder and a link to workflow artifacts.

+Integration with readiness poller
+--------------------------------
+We run the readiness poller daily and on every push to main. The poller posts a summary to Slack and upserts a comment on open PRs. Consider this behavior when selecting required status checks: the poller is informational and should not be added as a required status check unless you want readiness to gate merges. If you do want it to appear in PR checks, add the workflow named "Readiness Poller & Notifier" to the required contexts.

+# Readiness badge / README snippet
+
+Add this small snippet to your repository README to show a placeholder for the readiness last-run and a link to the workflow artifacts. Replace the placeholder URL with the Actions workflow run or artifacts URL you prefer (or keep as the workflow page).
+
+Markdown snippet to include in README:
+
+```markdown
+## Aegis Readiness
+
+![Aegis readiness](https://img.shields.io/badge/readiness-implemented-brightgreen)
+
+Last poll: <!-- insert timestamp here or leave blank for automation -->
+
+View latest artifacts and reports: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/readiness_poller.yml
+```
+
+Instructions:
+- Paste the block above into README.md where you'd like the readiness badge to appear.
+- Optionally replace the static link with the URL of the latest workflow run or artifact zip if you publish it somewhere.

+```
