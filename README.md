# Multimodal AI System Development Framework
This is a development framework for a multimodal AI system that I generated using DeepSeek. 
# Blueprint

A conceptual framework for building a self-hosted, multimodal AI assistant using open-weight models. This is not a single model, but an orchestration system that routes tasks to specialized models for reasoning, vision, and image generation.

## Features

*   **Core Reasoning:** Powered by DeepSeek-V2 or Llama 3.
*   **Multimodal Vision:** Uses LLaVA-NeXT for image understanding.
*   **Image Generation:** Integrated with Stable Diffusion XL.
*   **Real-time Data:** Can access web APIs for current information.
*   **Safety First:** Includes input/output safety checks.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Ensure you have a compatible GPU with sufficient VRAM.

## Usage

Run the main script: `python app.py`

## Disclaimer

This is a blueprint and requires significant hardware resources and customization to run effectively.
