# AEGIS SECURE MULTIMODAL MODEL DELIVERY SYSTEM

# Aegis Overview
* Aegis is a secure MLOps platform for managing, verifying, deploying and operating multimodal AI models.

# "Does It Do AI?"

# "Does It Provide Model Inference Out of the Box?"
* Aegis ships demo models and an inference playground, but real inference behavior depends on the model artifacts you (or we) supply.

* Enforced runtime verification (fail-closed)
* Multi-cloud deployment adapters and automation
* Canary rollouts + monitoring + automated rollback
