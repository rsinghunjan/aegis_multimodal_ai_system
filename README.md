# Aegis Secure Multimodal AI Model Delivery System

# Overview
* Aegis is an opinionated MLOps product that secures the entire model supply chain for multimodal AI: build → deterministic package → sign → verify → deploy → monitor → govern. It prevents unauthorized or tampered model artifacts from running in production by combining deterministic archives, cryptographic signing (Sigstore/cosign), CI verifiers (OIDC), fail‑closed runtime enforcement, and audited promotions — packaged with multi‑cloud deploy automation, canary rollouts, monitoring, and a lightweight governance UI.

# "Does It Do AI?"
* Aegis enables trustworthy AI - it makes your AI models safe, reproducible and auditable; you deploy your models into Aegis and Aegis ensures they are signed, verified, and rolled out safely.

# "Does It Provide Model Inference Out of the Box?"
* Aegis ships demo models and an inference playground, but real inference behavior depends on the model artifacts you (or we) supply.

# Product Core Offerings
* Secure model supply chain (deterministic packaging, signing, verifier)
* Enforced runtime verification (fail-closed)
* Multi-cloud deployment adapters and automation
* Canary rollouts + monitoring + automated rollback

# Customer Benefits
* Reduce risk of running untrusted or tampered models.
* Compliance/audit readiness and traceability for model promotions.
* Faster, safer model promotion from CI → staging → production.
