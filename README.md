# Aegis Multimodal AI System Development Framework
Aegis is a development framework for a multimodal AI system that I generated using DeepSeek. 

# Aegis Market Positioning
Only complete open-source multimodal agentic framework
First privacy-preserving enterprise AI platform
Only sustainable AI framework with carbon awareness
Comprehensive production-ready AI system



# Vision
A large langauge model (LLM) that has multimodal capabilities, large context windows, prioritizes AI safety and reliability, intelligence and analytical skills, real time data access, an open license that allows for customization and self-hosting, is able to perform in reasoning, coding and efficiency, has a range of options known for efficiency and multilingual support, and it has to be an efficient, open-weight model.

# Blueprint

A conceptual framework for building a self-hosted, multimodal AI assistant using open-weight models. This is not a single model, but an orchestration system that routes tasks to specialized models for reasoning, vision, and image generation.

## Features

*   **Core Reasoning:** Powered by DeepSeek-V2 or Llama 3.
*   **Multimodal Vision:** Uses LLaVA-NeXT for image understanding.
*   **Image Generation:** Integrated with Stable Diffusion XL.
*   **Real-time Data:** Can access web APIs for current information.
*   **Safety First:** Includes input/output safety checks.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repo: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.rtf`
3.  Ensure you have a compatible GPU with sufficient VRAM.

## Usage

Run the main script: `python app.py`

## Disclaimer

This is a blueprint and requires significant hardware resources and customization to run effectively.
